                    <p>I made this project in order to find a better way to buy and not panic when you have less money. At the beginning, I tried making a shopping cart animation but lacked the knowledge to complete it. So, I created a second version of an e-commerce. While challenging as a solo project, I found inspiration in Japan. Vending machines there provide a more efficient way to buy things, regulating spending by offering one item per transaction.</p>
                    <p>Japan is known for its vending machines, which are ubiquitous. You can find them in streets, subways, parks, and even remote areas. These machines offer hot and cold drinks, snacks, ice cream, fresh food, and even electronics. Advanced vending machines accept cash, credit cards, and smartphone payments, showcasing innovation and convenience.</p>
